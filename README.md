# Fuzzy Farms
**Intro**

This is a medium level Farm Prototype of a Unreal Engine v4 Game, done in only 2 weeks using ONLY unreals blueprints. I was given a challange in a college assignment to create a farming game using a design requirement sheet they gave me for resources. I also had to create a 3d model rig it and then implement in my game as a main mechanic which this prototype was mainly showing the proper implementation of my 3d model as well as texturing. This prototype includes: AI, NavMeshes, Custom Blender Models, Highly detailed blueprints, Spawning Mechanics, and basic inventory. The prototype is mainly to show off the spawning feature and unique varients of spawned animals such as them being all different colors. This could be used in a rougelite game or a game with procedual generation.

**Gameplay Implemented**

Due to the strict time constraint not everything was implemented in as I wanted too however this is implemented: 

- Wild Area where animals spawn. Each with Unqiue properties. 
- Pen Area where animals are already spawned with AI. You can see the Animals animations as well as their color changing properties. You can also see the AI implementation here. 
- Farm Area Where you can Pick up food. 
- Fuzzy Explaination It allows you to view the model from multiple different angles to check for clipping issues. 

Things *NOT* Implemented
- Capture mechanic. I wanted to implement a mechanic where you can capture the animals and place them in pens. 
- Shopkeeper area. This was a place where you can sell your captured Creatures. 
- Garden area. I wanted to implement an area where players can grow seeds that you can purchase from the shop keeper. 

I do not plan to Implement any of these however in the future I might remake this game and polish it. Making it a real demo.

**How To Play**

The game is currently in a sandbox state. There is no objective in this prototype it's simple a proof of concept and a gallery of what I created with a week long endevor. There is currently only 1 interactable actor inside the game which is the food you can pick up. Everything else can only be looked at and admired. Though you can test the AI and try to get infront of it's way.

**How It Can Be Exapanded**

The game could be expanded multiple different ways a good place to start is the things I haven't implemented due to time constaints. 

- Capture mechanic. I wanted to implement a mechanic where you can capture the animals and place them in pens. 
- Shopkeeper area. This was a place where you can sell your captured Creatures. 
- Garden area. I wanted to implement an area where players can grow seeds that you can purchase from the shop keeper.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

Q: "How do I Collect resources?"

A: Walk close to the item then press E

Q: "Why Post this open source?" 

A: I believe a good programmer should have code anyone can understand if they look at the source. With this project I wanted other to look at the code I created as it is neat and completely commented for easy documentation. Feel free to look and take any blueprints you like even the model! 

Q: "I think the shop keeper is broken as I can't interact with him" 

A: This was something I wanted to implement in the future. It serves as a place holder for a future shop. 

Q: "Why are the wild area fuzzies not moving?"

A: This is mainly due to a bug. While they do spawn they do not move because of a small bug with their code. With the 1 week long time constaint instead fixing that bug I made the hard choice to implement the AI and work on the coloring mechanic as it was more worth my grade.
